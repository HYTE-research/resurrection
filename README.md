  python -m venv .venv

Activate the environment:

  source .venv/bin/activate

Install the needed packages:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook. You can for example run a local Jupyter server on the command line or install and use Anaconda or Microsoft Visual Code.

Move to work with the notebook: [notebook_hellobrother.ipynb](notebook_hellobrother.ipynb).
